    "______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "There are many ways to browse through a SQL database, throughout this workshop we are going to be focusing on learning about SQL queries using a combination of Python, SQLite, and pandas. Please note that this is a pretty specific way of operating with a SQL Database, and may or may not fit other general needs. The primary goal of this section is to teach you how to use SQL queries to grab information and set it as a pandas DataFrame. We will not be going over more general topics of relational databases, MySQL, or using a SQL console directly.\n",

It's useful to prototype with SQLite and then port the code to a larger database system, like MySQL. Python comes with a module to connect to a SQL database with SQLite. The module is SQLite3, let's go ahead and import it (and pandas as well)."
